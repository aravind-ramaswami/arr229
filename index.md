Hello, my name is Aravind Ramaswami and I am from Tucson, Arizona. I am a senior studying mechanical engineering and robotics at Cornell University. I enjoy hiking, playing tennis, and going to the gym in my free time. I am very interested in robotics, particularly creating robots that can operate in extreme environments. This website will showcase my work during fast robots in spring 2025.
